# Mac CLI Setup

Set up for a great CLI workspace on a mac.

## How To Use

1. `chmod a+x run.sh`

2. `./run.sh`

3. After complete, open **iterm**, press `âŒ˜ ,`

    1. Profile -> Text -> Change Font

    2. Set font to Roboto Mono for Powerline, Font Size 14 (Medium font and font size dependent on screen size).

## What it Does

TODO

## Terminal

The script sets up the terminal essentially as suggested by Kevin Smets [here](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070). This includes Iterm2, Oh-My-Zsh, PowerLevel9K, Solarized Dark Theme, and syntax highlighting.

## IDE

I currently like VSCode as an IDE due to aesthetic appearance, useful packages, and commodity of features.
